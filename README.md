1)
choose num nodes.
For each pair of nodes (each edge):
    Assign weight [0.0, 1.0)  Math.random

2)
find edgelist of minimum spanning tree (prim's or kruskal's)

3)
place nodes based on presentation using min span tree edgelist

4)
Find weight value of when the network becomes fully connected

5)
Show nodes.
Per each edge in increasing weight order:
    Add edge
    Present as connected or disconnected
